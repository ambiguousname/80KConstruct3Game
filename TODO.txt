What we need to do:
- Add sound effects and music?

Feedback from play testing:
- Balloon is still too small



Known bugs:

Digger sometimes just ignores pitfalls? (Forgot this was intentional. After hitting a pitfall,
the digger will have some immunity for a time)

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?) (Done)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps

Tyler's Playtest Notes:

Balloon in the fifth level makes it looks like you need to move the jumper enemy there instead 
of using the pitfall.


Wendi's play testing note:

- the crosshair image would confuse players (maybe we can write a reminder beforehand that the crosshair won't die when you have a collision with the NPCs)

- The arrows in UITutorial level make player think that they should place the trap there

- the lower right user interface sometimes would not be notice (player always forgot to buy the trap)

- refund function doesn't work for both traps in tutorial level6

- as the players use up all of the coins, they don't know how to do

- no one use the block

- sometimes it's hard to tell/remember each trap just from looking at their names (maybe we can add icons at top of the lower right UI, reminding players the traps' skins, just like we used to do)
