What we need to do:
- Fix and polish existing levels.
- Level transitions?
- Add sound effects and music - After first draft is done
- Better looking wind and piston traps?
- Make Jumper immune to Snake until it hits a pitfall
- Make animation for enemies' reactions to the snake


Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

Balloon and Snake traps are really tiny when placed?

Whip enemy can't jump over pitfall?

Digger sometimes just ignores pitfalls?

When you refund snake trap while enemy is snaked, they'll stop moving.

Defeating all enemies won't start the next level (maybe exclusive to Balloon trap?)

Whip enemy will continually jump forever if it hits a block and a pitfall.

Whip enemy will also just sit on top of snake trap.

Wind trap sometimes causes enemies to bug out?

Maybe set it so refunding the trapdoor or piston just gives the piston and trapdoor back?

More of an aesthetic thing, but if you close the trapdoor while an enemy is falling in, they still
remain on top of the trapdoor.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?) (Done)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps

Tyler's Playtest Notes:
Players didn't know how to restart the game from the game over screen, and
had to start all the way back at the start screen. Maybe a way to transition to 
previously unlocked levels from the game over screen?

Controls are somewhat difficult to use (maybe Q to purchase instead of P?).

Hard to tell if the traps are going to be hit or not by enemies (generous hitboxes? Straigher enemy paths?)

Need a better indicator of what trap is selected and if you have any

Indicators to show what traps you get from doing stuff.

Pitfalls and Trapdoors sometimes don't work on Digger enemy

Make it clearer that after the Jumper jumps, for a while they're vulnerable (new animation?)

Make inventory more visual? (Player has to spend time seeing how many traps they have and of what type)

Make it so that there's an "Unbuyable" option for inventory items

Illustrate enemies are vulnerable to other traps after snake trap (new animation? Visual indicator?)

Balloon in the fifth level makes it looks like you need to move the jumper enemy there instead 
of using the pitfall.


Wendi's play testing note:

- the crosshair image would confuse players (maybe we can write a reminder beforehand that the crosshair won't die when you have a collision with the NPCs)

- The arrows in UITutorial level make player think that they should place the trap there

- the lower right user interface sometimes would not be notice (player always forgot to buy the trap)

- refund function doesn't work for both traps in tutorial level6

- as the players use up all of the coins, they don't know how to do

- no one use the block

- sometimes it's hard to tell/remember each trap just from looking at their names (maybe we can add icons at top of the lower right UI, reminding players the traps' skins, just like we used to do)
