What we need to do:
- Fix and polish existing levels.
- Level transitions?
- Add sound effects and music - After first draft is done
- Better looking wind and piston traps?
- Make Jumper immune to Snake until it hits a pitfall
- Make animation for enemies' reactions to the snake
- Change it so that you can see visually what trap you've selected (and how much of that trap you have)
- Make it so that if a trap costs 500, it's clear that you can't buy it.
- Add restart button from game over
- Level select screen?
- Add visual effect to Jumper to show that they're vulnerable a few seconds after they jump?
- Add visual effect while an enemy is being affected by the snake trap (Whip enemy already has animation,
visual effect for other enemies?).


Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

Whip enemy can't jump over pitfall?

Digger sometimes just ignores pitfalls? (Forgot this was intentional. After hitting a pitfall,
the digger will have some immunity for a time)

Whip enemy will also just sit on top of snake trap.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?) (Done)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps

Tyler's Playtest Notes:

Balloon in the fifth level makes it looks like you need to move the jumper enemy there instead 
of using the pitfall.


Wendi's play testing note:

- the crosshair image would confuse players (maybe we can write a reminder beforehand that the crosshair won't die when you have a collision with the NPCs)

- The arrows in UITutorial level make player think that they should place the trap there

- the lower right user interface sometimes would not be notice (player always forgot to buy the trap)

- refund function doesn't work for both traps in tutorial level6

- as the players use up all of the coins, they don't know how to do

- no one use the block

- sometimes it's hard to tell/remember each trap just from looking at their names (maybe we can add icons at top of the lower right UI, reminding players the traps' skins, just like we used to do)
