For the Construct 3 Demo, we need:
- Placeholder art (with the general style that our final game is going to have) - Wendi
- Buying traps - Wendi
- Mission Timer (Currently missions have the same total time throughout. Maybe have something
to update it per level?) - Wendi
- Replacing demo art with different art? - Wendi
- Add enemy animations to show stuff like jumping and swinging. - Wendi
- Start screen, functional (and nice looking) win and lose screens - Wendi
- Polish background ??
- Add more levels - Tyler (Do Monday)
- (For Boss' duplicate, give them the solid property so the player
can't place a trap directly underneath them).
- Add Enemy (and trap) type skins (Do Monday) - Tyler
- Get all Enemy types actually working in the code. (Boss' Weakness isn't actually moved by any traps.
Need to get it working with the Piston and Wind)
- Add sound effects and music - After first draft is done
- Set different coin and time limit amounts per level (Do Monday)

Trap reconfigurations:
- Wind Trap - How to tell the player is facing in a specific direction? Answer: Get player to rotate
towards mouse cursor?
How to get wind to come out? Answer: Can use particles, but have the sprite extend outward, invisibly.

- Rocket Trap - Instead of this, maybe a piston trap (easier to model)? Also, make it a stronger version
of the wind trap (gives good reason to use it)


Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

(In the first level, coins 

Player coins don't update on collection or on the start of a layout.

More of an aesthetic thing, but if you close the trapdoor while an enemy is falling in, they still
remain on top of the trapdoor.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?) (Done)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps
