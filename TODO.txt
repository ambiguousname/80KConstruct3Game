What we need to do:
- Polish background ??
- Fix and polish existing levels.
- Add sound effects and music - After first draft is done
- Better looking wind and piston traps?


Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

In the first level, the jumper enemy in the top left won't collide with balloons

Whip enemy will continually jump forever if it hits a block and a pitfall.

Wind trap sometimes causes enemies to bug out?

Maybe set it so refunding the trapdoor or piston just gives the piston and trapdoor back?

More of an aesthetic thing, but if you close the trapdoor while an enemy is falling in, they still
remain on top of the trapdoor.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?) (Done)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps
