For the Construct 3 Demo, we need:
- Placeholder art (with the general style that our final game is going to have) - Wendi
- Buying traps - Wendi
- Mission Timer - Wendi
- Add winning layout and connection from level
- Add losing layout and connection from level
- Replacing demo art with more cohesive style? (Do this when demo is finished, the demo art looks somewhat disparate)
- Add enemy animations to show stuff like jumping and swinging.
- Add all the trap types (After the demo is done) - Tyler
- Add all the enemy types (After demo is done) - Tyler
- Add more visual indicators to show when enemies are and aren't immune to traps (After demo is done) - Tyler
- Credits screen with all of the assets we used (MUST HAVE)
- Refunding Traps and Adding rewards for getting rid of enemies - Tyler (Wait for Buying traps to be done)
- Maybe some sound effects and/or music? - Tyler
