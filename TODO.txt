For the Construct 3 Demo, we need:
- Placeholder art (with the general style that our final game is going to have) - Wendi
- Buying traps - Wendi
- Mission Timer - Wendi
- Add winning layout and connection from level
- Add losing layout and connection from level
- Replacing demo art with more cohesive style? (Do this when demo is finished, the demo art looks somewhat disparate)
- Add enemy animations to show stuff like jumping and swinging.
- Add all the trap types (After the demo is done) - Tyler
- Add all the enemy types (After demo is done) - Tyler
- Add more visual indicators to show when enemies are and aren't immune to traps (After demo is done) - Tyler
- Credits screen with all of the assets we used (MUST HAVE)
- Rewards for defeating enemies? - Tyler
- Maybe some sound effects and/or music? - Tyler

Known bugs:
Cannot refund blocks. It's because refunding traps requires the player to be over 
whatever trap they placed. Also, blocks have to be solid for them to stop enemies,
and the player must have collision enabled. My solution would be to disable player
collisions, but that means we'd have to get rid of coins.

Enemies stop moving if player scrolls to them, but only sometimes? Probably something to do with how
MoveTo and the player's Scroll work together, as well as the fact that the enemy will only start moving
again after they arrive at their destination.
