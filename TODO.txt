For the Construct 3 Demo, we need:
- Placeholder art (with the general style that our final game is going to have)
- Buying traps
- Player movement and collision
- Enemies wandering around that can fall into pits
- Selecting and placing different traps (maybe include 1 or 2 of the traps from our miro board?)
- Maybe some sound effects and/or music?
