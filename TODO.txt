Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

(In the first level, coins 

Enemies stop moving if player scrolls to them, but only sometimes? Probably something to do with how
MoveTo and the player's Scroll work together, as well as the fact that the enemy will only start moving
again after they arrive at their destination.

Player coins don't update on collection or on the start of a layout.

More of an aesthetic thing, but if you close the trapdoor while an enemy is falling in, they still
remain on top of the trapdoor.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps
