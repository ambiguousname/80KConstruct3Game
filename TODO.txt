For the Construct 3 Demo, we need:
- Placeholder art (with the general style that our final game is going to have) - Wendi
- Buying traps - Wendi
- Mission Timer (Currently missions have the same total time throughout. Maybe have something
to update it per level?) - Wendi
- Replacing demo art with different art? - Wendi
- Add enemy animations to show stuff like jumping and swinging. - Wendi
- Start screen, functional (and nice looking) win and lose screens - Wendi
- Polish background ??
- Add more levels - Tyler
- Add all the trap types - Tyler
- Add all the enemy types - Tyler
- Rewards for defeating enemies? - Tyler
- Maybe some sound effects and/or music


Feedback from play testing:
- Add a tutorial section before the game starts.
- Maybe increase countdown.


Known bugs:

Enemies stop moving if player scrolls to them, but only sometimes? Probably something to do with how
MoveTo and the player's Scroll work together, as well as the fact that the enemy will only start moving
again after they arrive at their destination.

Player coins don't update on collection or on the start of a layout.

Playtest Notes:
Liked the balloon animation
Make it clearer how you can buy traps (Separate tutorials for each concept of placing and buying traps?)
Don't have a timer for the tutorial.
Liked experimenting with different traps
